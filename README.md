# Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?
A Machine Learning project using a dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied). 

The dataset used in this project contains data about loans guarantees by the U.S Small Business Administration (SBA). I'm gonna use ML algorithms in order to predict the status of each loan (either be paid in full or default),
